<div class="hero">Learn. Code. Teach. Repeat.</div>

I am a *Rust* software engineer at [Standard AI](https://standard.ai/), where I
focus on building robust and efficient systems. I started programming as a kid
and began my professional career 18 years ago, building a strong foundation in
*C++* and *C*, particularly for Linux and embedded environments.

Throughout my career, I have been passionate about sharing knowledge --
designing and delivering training sessions and courses in both Italian and
English. I enjoy helping others master the intricacies of modern C++ and *Rust*,
and I value clear communication and collaborative learning.

If you would like to connect or discuss technology, feel free to reach out to
me on LinkedIn.
